Overview of tutorial models
===========================

In order to setup a model using ShorleineS code, The use should have MATLAB or Octave installed.

Using the below link, the ShorelineS model code and examples can be downloaded:

To make the setting up of basic models easier, making a ShorelineS model is supported by 2 open source available options:

* Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make ShorelineS models interactively: **'Delft Dashboard'**  --Under Develeopment
* Matlab scripts toolbox in the **'Open Earth Toolbox'**

If you need a more tailor-made solution for setting up your ShorelineS models get in touch with us!

Open Earth Tools
-----
Checkout the Open Earth Tools from: 
To make the functionality available, run the function oetsettings

.. figure:: ./images/image_001.png
   :width: 800px
   :align: center

   Setting the functions path and running the oetsettings through the command line of MATLAB	

In the Open Earth Tools a toolbox of Matlab scripts is included to have more flexibility in setting up your ShorelineS models.
Throughout this User Manual examples of how to use these scripts are given in the code blocks '**Matlab example using OET**'.
For a general overview of possible input files and how to create them using Matlab scripts see: https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/openearthtools/trunk/matlab/applications/sfincs/
For getting started with Open Earth Tools see: https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/OET/OpenEarth
